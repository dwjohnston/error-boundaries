Bootstrapped with CRA. 

Run `yarn && yarn start`

There are three different approachs. 

Flakey Component 1 - Demonstrates that a straight error boundary will not work 

Flakey Component 2 - Works - but demonstrates that you probably want to keep the container 

Flakey Component 3 - Has the experience that I want. 

I don't know of a way to do this with hooks or componenent.
